# Omni-Analyst: Multi-Agent AI Verification System

A 9-phase protocol for AI research with built-in cross-verification to 
eliminate hallucination.

## The Problem
Current AI systems hallucinate facts with no verification layer. This 
causes legal liability, reputational damage, and unreliable research.

## The Solution
Multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to verify information before 
output:
- Search agents find sources
- Analysis agents extract claims
- Verification agents cross-check claims against sources
- Synthesis agents produce reports from verified data only

## Proof of Concept
The `proof-of-concept/` directory contains a working PyTorch simulation 
demonstrating the core verification logic using a Dissonance Resolution 
Architecture.

## Architecture
See `architecture/` for complete technical specifications.

## Status
Architecture complete. Seeking technical co-founder for implementation.
